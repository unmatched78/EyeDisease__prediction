# Overview
Our eyes are vital organs that connect us to the world, allowing us to appreciate its wonders and navigate our surroundings. Unfortunately, they are also vulnerable to various diseases—most notably **Glaucoma**, **Diabetic Retinopathy**, and **Cataracts**. **Early detection and timely treatment** of these conditions are essential for preserving vision.

# Eye Diseases

- ## Glaucoma  
  A group of disorders characterized by damage to the optic nerve—the cable that carries visual data from the eye to the brain. Left untreated, glaucoma can cause irreversible vision loss and even complete blindness.

- ## Diabetic Retinopathy  
  A complication of diabetes in which elevated blood sugar levels harm the tiny blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye). Over time, this damage can lead to partial or total vision loss.

- ## Cataracts  
  A clouding of the eye’s natural lens that blurs and distorts vision. While aging is the most common cause, trauma, genetic factors, or certain medications can also trigger cataract formation. Symptoms include haziness, double vision, and sensitivity to glare.

By deepening our understanding of these diseases—their causes, progression, and impact on sight—we can improve strategies for early diagnosis and management. This project demonstrates an **image-based classification approach** designed to distinguish between healthy eyes and those affected by glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, or cataracts.
